1. Write a class to represent a vector (a series of float values). Include member functions  to perform the following tasks:  
(a) To create the vector.  
(b) To modify the value of a given element.  
(c) To multiply by a scalar value.  
(d) To display the vector in the form (10, 20, 30 â€¦)  
Write a program to test your class.

2. Create two classes DM and DB which store the value of distances. DM stores distances  in meters and centimeters and DB in feet and inches. Write a program that can read  values for the class objects and add one object of DM with another object of DB.  Use a friend function to carry out the addition operation. The object that stores the  results may be a DM object or DB object, depending on the units in which the results  are required.  
The display should be in the format of feet and inches or meters and centimeters  depending on the object on display.
